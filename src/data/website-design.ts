    { q: 'What do you need from me?', a: 'One 60-minute call, logins to anything that already exists (an old site, a domain, a Google listing), and any photos you have. Phone photos are fine. We write the pages and handle the technical setup, and you review everything before launch.' },
    { q: 'How long does it take?', a: 'A standard build goes from first call to launch in 15 days. You see a working preview by Day 3, review the site on Days 11 to 13, and go live on Days 14 to 15. Custom builds get their own timeline in writing before work starts.' },
    { q: 'Do I own my website and domain?', a: 'Yes, completely. The domain and hosting are registered in your name, and the content, photos and code are yours. If you ever leave, it all goes with you.' },
    { q: 'Will my site show up on Google?', a: 'It is set up to be found, with the on-page search work built in and your Google Business Profile connected. Rankings build over time, and nobody can promise a specific position. Most businesses see real movement over several months.' },
    { q: 'Can you rebuild my existing website?', a: "Yes. We audit what you have, keep and rewrite the content that works, set up redirects so your search rankings carry over, and rebuild the rest. You keep what you've already earned." },
    { q: 'Do I have to write the content?', a: 'No. From one phone call we learn enough about your business to write the pages. You review the words before launch, and most owners change less than they expect.' },
    { q: 'What happens after launch?', a: 'You get close support for fixes during the first two weeks, then an optional ongoing support arrangement. Changes and questions are a call to the same contact, not a ticket to a queue.' },
    { q: 'Can I make changes later?', a: 'Anytime. Small changes are quick calls. Bigger additions get a clear price before any work starts.' },
