/**
 * /services/ai-automation. Plain English for contractors and local service owners.
 *
 * Sources: the repo's automation copy (PILLAR_AUTOMATION), the live site's AI
 * Automation section (form-to-text, instant auto-replies, missed-call
 * text-back, AI follow-up with qualifying questions and booking, one log for
 * calls and inquiries), our own blog posts, and a structure-only review of US
 * missed-call text-back and lead-follow-up tools.
 *
 * OPEN for Srii before treating as final:
 *  - There are no prices in the repo for this service. The page shows one
 *    "quoted on the call" card, with PRICE_MASK.
 *  - Lines marked CONFIRM go beyond the live site's list.
 *  - No recovery-rate or response-time statistics appear. Vendor claims such
 *    as "recovers 25 to 45 percent of missed calls" are unverified and left out.
 *    Statistics already sourced in src/data/home.ts are not repeated here
 *    because that page carries their source lists.
 *  - The page says plainly that automation starts the conversation and a
 *    person continues it.
